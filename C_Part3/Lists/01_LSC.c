/*
A Singly Linked List (SLL) is a data structure made up of linked elements (links), with each link represented by a structure containing a value (data) and a pointer to the next link.
A SLL starts from a head (which we'll simply call sll for the following exercises) linked to all subsequent elements. The last element points to 'NULL' to mark the end of the LSC.
1. Create a 'Link'  structure corresponding to a link in an LSC via typedef struct, containing a pointer next to the next 'Link' and an integer, called value.
2. Code a function int sll_length(Link* sll) taking as input the head of an LSC and returning the length of the listwith an iterative algorithm.

typedef struct Link{
    struct Link *next;
    int value;
} Link;

int sll_length(Link* sll){
    if (sll == NULL){
        return 0;
    }
    int count = 1;
    Link *ptr = sll;
    while (ptr->next != NULL){
        count++;
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }
    return count;
